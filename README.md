Demonstrates the use of a 16x2 LCD display. The EOroboticsdispaly library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the  Hitachi eorobotics driver. There are many of them out there, and you  can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface. 

The library currenly comes with the following i/o subclass:

eoroboticsdispaly.h control LCD with native eoroboticsdispaly (Display eoroboticsdispaly)


Installation
For generic information about Arduino libraries and how to install them consult the Arduino Libraries page: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

For ease of proper installation, the preferred method of installing the library is to use the library manager. The use of importing a .zip file is highly discouraged unless using IDE versions prior to version 1.6.2

Installation using Library manager (IDE 1.6.2 and later)
In the IDE, Simply click on:
[Sketch]->Include Library->Manage Libraries...
or
[Tools]->Manage Libraries...
Then search for "Extensible hd44780" to locate the library and install it.
There is no need to uninstall or modify any other LCD libary that may have already been installed.

Installation using zip file w/o library manager (IDE 1.6.1 and earlier)
Installation requires downloading a zip image and then, depending on the version of the IDE you can either install it from the IDE or install it manually by unziping the file into your sketchbook libraries.

NOTE: due to the way github creates its zip files, there is a manual step that must be done to rename the library directory created in your sketchbook libraries area.
